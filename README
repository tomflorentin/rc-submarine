# RC Submarine

## Overview

### Context

This is for me a personal project, that started from a crazy idea of creating a submarine 100% by myself. As a experimented software developer, i want to diversify my knowledge to other disciplines.
In this case, i can improve my electronics ability, and also general engineering : two domains where I did not have any basis to start this project.

### Conception phase

I first started to document myself about submarines main challenges.
They are :
- Waterproofness, handling pression
- Ability to change electronically volume/mass ratio to dive/float
- Miniaturization, efficiently using available space.

So i started unrealistic drawings (see first-drawing.jpg in the repo) trying to solve theses issues.
At the time i started the project, chatGPT rised from nowhere, so i used it a lot to discuss about it and fill my absolute ignorance about electronics.
I created lot of 3D pieces with Fusion360.
